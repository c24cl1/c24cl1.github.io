			10/20/20: So far in Comp Sci I have made the beginnings of a website where you pop bubbles on bubble wrap and a person card. The final form of the bubble wrap website will hopefully be a website that is just an image of bubble wrap and then when you click on the bubbles it pops. Even though the idea is pretty simple most of my frustration so far in this class has been caused by trying to add an event listener to my bubble wrap code because even though I watched a video and looked up tutorials about how to add an event listener and even though it looks like my ocde should be working it doesn’t. Overall that is the most frustrating part of coding for me when you have an error somewhere in your code and you keep looking through your code but for whatever reason you can’t figure out what is wrong. Especially when you are not in a place where you can just instantly ask a question to someone who is right there. Even scheduling a lab to solve an issue like that can be frustrating because you are just stuck there until you can have your lab. Overall I’m feeling pretty good about comp sci this year even though at the beginning of the year I was slightly apprehensive about taking the class because in the past when I came into contact with coding it was with people that already knew what they were doing and so I just wouldn’t get involved but when I started the class I realized that everyone else was just starting as well and that it was an intro class with nothing to worry about. One thing that I want to work on moving forward is my understanding of the code. By which I mean I want to be better at figuring out what I need to change or add in order to do the things that I want to do. I feel like for the most part I can have a good understanding of the code if it is clear what it is saying but when it is a little less clear then I want to get better at deciphering what it is saying if for nothing else than to be able to look it up or ask a question about it.

			11/2/20: This week I began working on my personal website and it was a pretty frustrating endeavor. I have this idea of what I want to do with the website to make it really cool and what I want from it but then I start to try and code it and even with the help of w3 schools I still can't figure it out. I'm gonna have a lab with Ms. Josesphs to try and acheive my vision a little bit more especially beacause I'm going to be putting all of my work throughout the year on this website. Even though it's frustrating to not see my goal for the website realized I still like what I have so far with the color scheme and the menu bar at the top.

			11/9/20: This week went better than last week but there were still some problems. I met with Ms. Josephs in a lab which was helpful in figuring out where I wanted to take my website and how I wanted to style it while keeping with the minimalistic vibe that I wanted it to be. With Ms. Josephs' help I decided on a topography map to take up most of my home page and I also fixed the styling on my menu bar. Even though Ms. Josephs helped me with brining the image into my website I still had some trouble figuring out how to import the image but with the help of W3 schools I figured out a solution in not too mmuch time. My main struggle this week was putting my website online and putting it on my person card. I can put my website online pretty easily just with a few questions but with my person card I wasn't entirely sure on what I was supposed to do and even after looking at the example person cards I was still a little confused about what to do. I'm going to ask Ms. Josephs in class tomorrow though or maybe schedule a lab with her to problem solve.
